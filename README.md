## Vulkan Validation Layers HarmonyOS

This repository contains the documented process for pushing Vulkan Validation Layer on a Huawei phone.

This is compatible with Vulkan 1.3 and contains the necessary declarations to validate for vkCreateSurfaceOHOS (Huawei's surface creation method for a HarmonyOS window)

### TODO

- Write a script to build the Vulkan Validation Layers without any intervention or as minimal intervention as possible (2nd).

- Test the written process works properly (1st).
